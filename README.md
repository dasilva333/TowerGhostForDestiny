##Known Issues

-    Moving materials/consumables causing splits/merges is still buggy
-    DestinyExotics doesn't recognize certain weapons you might have
-    Mobile app has problems logging in
-    Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/dasilva333/TowerGhostForDestiny/issues) for more information
-    Keyboard hides away for some users

##Troubleshooting 
Xbox & PSN Support now available, the app should prompt you to log in with Bungie.net using XBL or PSN credentials [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/xzrpKxV.png) if you don't see that message then go to Settings > Log in XBL/PSN and click Done when complete. After clicking Done the items should load automatically give it a few seconds to load, if the page doesn't load after sign in then try Settings > Refresh Items. Good luck guys and remember this is still a beta build.
Keyboard Disappears? Go to Settings and disable Loadstop Listener, log in, enable it back in, and log in again.
